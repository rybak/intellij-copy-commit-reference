## To Do

- Bump versions of GitHub actions
- Create branch release-v1
    > Versions 1.* will be capped for compatibility. See git commit messages for until-build and other compatibility changes.

## Doing

- Building instructions
    * [x] double check building from source instructions
    * [x] double check debugging from IDE instructions
    * [x] push to `main`
    * [ ] write "Release process" instructions

## Done

- Gif in README
    > Rejected as being too distracting
    * [x] Decide if README with a gif is better than with static screenshot
    * [ ] If gif is better, push it to `main`
